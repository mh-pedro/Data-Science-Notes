    "The goal in statistics is to make a statement about the population, however, in most cases it is not possible to get all data of the population, so a representative sample is taken. This sample is then analyzed using descriptive statistic, which helps summarize key characteristics, such as the mean and the variability within the sample. However, describing the sample may not be sufficient to make a statement about the population as a whole. In these cases, inferential statistic is used to make predictions about the population based on the sample.\n",

    "\n",
    " - **Simple random sampling:** Every member of the subset has an equal chance of being selected. We can use this method when all members of the population have similar properties. The exemple the we doing before is a simple random sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Systematic sampling:** The members of a population are selected at a random point with a fixed sampling interval. For exemple, in a classe with 50 students but only 10 books to give to these students. The sampling interval is fixed by dividing the number of students by the number of books, in this case, we have 50/10 = 5. For exemple, take the number 18, the other students selected to get the books will be as follows: 18, 23, 28, 33, 38, 43, 48, 3, 8, 13. The problem with systematic sampling is associated with the ordem. If we want the best students in math correspond to the sequencial order initially? This can introduced a bias in your sample.\n",
    "\n",
    " - **Stratified sampling:** In this method,  we divide the population into homogeneous subpopulations called **strata**. Each stratum splits have distinctly properties, lie as gender, age, color and etc. The members in each stratum has an equal chance of being selected."
